### Used Car Prices Prediction  
**(R, Regression Analysis)**  

This project aimed to predict used car prices with high accuracy using regression models. Data from Kaggle was utilized, and extensive feature engineering was conducted to include attributes such as mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, and car brand. Advanced regression techniques, including Ridge and Lasso regression, were applied alongside hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The final model achieved robust predictive accuracy, offering valuable insights
